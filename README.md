# thecacklingcrow
The Cackling Crow blog website repository.

# How it works
This repo is used for hosting the [thecacklingcrow.com](https://thecacklingcrow.com/), and also outlines the process of hosting a website for free using GitHub for hosting, WordPress for managing the website content, and a Raspberry Pi for hosting a local editable version of the website. 

## Structure
The diagram below shows how the different part of this project interact with eachother.

## Benefits
- Free (other than optional cost of a domian name)
- Basically the same usage as a regular WordPress site
- Secuity benefits (your live WordPress site won't be accissble from the open internet, only the a static version it will be accessible)
- GitHub will store your website history
- You get a home server that serves to the open internet without having to open your home network to serve a website
- A static IP isn't needed (or the use of a Dynamic DNS service)

## Limitations
- Since this is a static site, users will not be able to leave comments
- No default support for viewing web traffic
- Since it relies on free hosting from GitHub, there is no support and no guaruntee the service will remain availible
- GitHub will store your website history (anyone will be able to see if they find your public repo)

# Use
After you've followed the [Installation](#installation) instructions, you can access your WordPress website through a browser that's connected to the same network as the Raspberry Pi. You can make any changes to your website you'd like using the regular WordPress interface. Once you've saved your changes, your live website will automatically be updated the same day (at midnight).

## Setup the Raspberry Pi
1. Install Raspbian on a raspberry pi
   1. Get a Raspberry Pi. This project used the model 4, but it should work on most models. 
   2. Download and install the Raspbery Pi Imager found [here](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)
   3. Use the Raspbery Pi Imager to load "Raspberry Pi OS Lite", the command-line only version of the Raspbian OS to a SD Card. 
   4. Under advanced options: Enable SSH, configure the Wifi if needed, and set a local hostname (eg: `crow.local`)
      For the rest of these instuctions, substiture `crow.local` for whatever you chose as a local hostname
   6. Note the username and password you choose (eg `crow`)
      For the rest of these instuctions, substiture `crow` for whatever you chose as a username on the Pi

## Setup Git syncing on the Raspberry Pi
1. SSH into the Raspberry Pi (see step 1 of the section [Install Wordpress on the Raspberry Pi](#install-wordpress-on-the-raspberry-pi) for more details)
1. `sudo apt-get update`
2. `sudo apt-get install git`
3. `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "{associated crow email}"` (your github email)
4. `cat /home/crow/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`, copy content
5. Add that key as a write access deployment key for the repo on github
   1. In a brower (not the command-line), goto the repo on github.com
   2. Goto the Settings (along the top) > Deploy keys (along the side)
   3. Click `Add Deploy key` and paste the content you coppied above under `Key`

11. `cd {repo}`
12. Get the `clean.sh` and `update.sh` scripts from this repo (warning: these scripts will autmatically delete everything in your repo that's not part of your site, `.github` config files, the `README.md` file, or these two scripts themselves)
   1. `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abitwitch/thecacklingcrow/main/clean.sh`
   2. `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abitwitch/thecacklingcrow/main/update.sh`

## Set up a Cron job on the Raspberry Pi
1. SSH into the Raspberry Pi (see step 1 of the section [Install Wordpress on the Raspberry Pi](#install-wordpress-on-the-raspberry-pi) for more details)
1. `sudo crontab -e` (you may have you pick a default text editor, I recommend Nano for beginners)
2. add this line `0 0 * * * /usr/bin/bash /home/crow/thecacklingcrow/update.sh` (this will mean the Raspberry Pi will apply any changes you've made to your site locally to the open web at Midnight every night)
